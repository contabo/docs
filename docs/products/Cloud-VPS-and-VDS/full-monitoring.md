# Learn more about your Virtual Server
More information is always better, right?

We can offer you a "Full Monitoring" tool that may be useful depending on your use case. The clear advantage is the reaction time, as the data is transmitted directly from the host system. 


To learn more, see:

> Check out our [PRICES](https://contabo.com/en/product-list/) to see how cheap the monthly fee really is.

Our Full Monitoring Add-On gives you access to a control panel where you can monitor your server and set up alerts via email or **text messages** (50 text messages per month included). Among other things, you can monitor: server bandwidth usage directly in our switch, downtime, Apache and FTP performance. 

Adding/ordering this add-on is fully automated. 

Please use your [Customer Dashboard](https://my.contabo.com/abos) to order the add-on in the "VPS Control" tab via the "Manage" button next to the server - and select "Order Add-on". Fill out the order form displayed and we will provide you with the add-on within the next 3 hours.

### Anyone wanted some free alternatives?

We can recommend a software tool like "Munin" or "Grafana" or "htop" with which you can monitor hardware and bandwidth usage.
