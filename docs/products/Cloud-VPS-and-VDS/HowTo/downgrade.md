## Downgrade of a VPS

Sometimes - our customers do not require the full performance available with their current VPS. This may happen when your use-case shifts to a different direction, or due to a cost optimization.

We can however inform you that a **downgrade** (this technically means / is defined as a _change_ → to a VPS which has lower storage capacity) is sadly not currently possible due to the limited feasibility and the necessary manual attention of our technicians. It can only be currently realized by ordering a new smaller plan on our website of the desired size:

-> To order a smaller VPS plan [CLICK HERE](https://contabo.com/?show=vps)

With this new smaller plan provisioned, configured, and installed, you can transfer the files from your VPS to the new
one and cancel your old  VPS on the next possible due date via your customer control
panel. This generaly completes the migration process.

Retainment of your IP during this process is unfortunately not achievable.
